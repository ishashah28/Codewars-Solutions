You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

For example:

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]

Should return: 11

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]

Should return: 160

# My solution
def find_outlier(integers):
    even = [i for i in integers if i % 2 == 0]
    odd = [i for i in integers if i % 2 == 1]
    return odd[0] if len(odd)<len(even) else even[0]
    
find_outlier([2,3,4,6])
